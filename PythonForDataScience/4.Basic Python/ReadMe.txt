The focus of this chapter is to provide you with a good overview of how
Python works as a language. Of course, part of that focus is how you use
Python to solve data science problems. However, you can’t use this book to
learn Python from scratch. To learn Python from scratch, you need a book
such as my book Beginning Programming with Python For Dummies (published
by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) or a tutorial such as the one at https://docs.
python.org/2/tutorial/. The chapter assumes that you’ve worked with
other programming languages and have at least an idea of how Python works.
This limitation aside, the chapter gives you a good reminder of how things
work in Python, which is all that many people really need.
