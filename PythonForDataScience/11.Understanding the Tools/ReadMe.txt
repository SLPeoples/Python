Up to this point, the book spends a lot of time working with Python
to perform data science tasks without actually engaging the tools
provided by Anaconda much. Yes, a good deal of what you do involves typing
in code and seeing what happens. However, if you don’t actually know how
to use your tools well, you miss opportunities to perform tasks easier and
faster. Automation is an essential part of performing data science tasks in
Python.
This chapter is about working with the two main Anaconda tools, IPython
console and IPython Notebook. Earlier chapters give you some experience
with both tools, but those chapters don’t explore either tool in any detail, and
you need to know these tools a lot better for upcoming chapters. The skills
you develop in this chapter will help you perform tasks in later chapters with
greater speed and far less effort.
The chapter also looks at tasks you can perform with your newfound skills.
You develop even more skills as the book progresses, but these tasks help
put your new skills into perspective and appreciate how you can use them to
make working with Python even easier.
You don’t have to manually type the source code for this chapter. In fact,
it’s a lot easier if you use the downloadable source. The source code for this
chapter appears in the P4DS4D; 11; Understanding the Tools.ipynb
source code file. (See the Introduction for details on where to locate this file.)
