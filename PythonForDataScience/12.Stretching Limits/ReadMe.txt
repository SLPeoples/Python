If you’ve gone through the previous chapters, by this point you’ve dealt
with all the basic data loading and manipulation methods offered by
Python. Now it’s time to start using some more complex instruments for data
wrangling (or munging) and for machine learning. The final step of most data
science projects is to build a data tool able to automatically summarize, predict,
and recommend directly from your data.
Before taking that final step, you still have to massage your data by enforcing
transformations that are even more radical. That’s the data wrangling or data
munging part, where sophisticated transformations are followed by visual
and statistical explorations, and then again by further transformations. In the
following sections, you learn how to handle huge streams of text, explore the
basic characteristics of a dataset, optimize the speed of your experiments,
compress data and create new synthetic features, generate new groups and
classifications, and detect unexpected or exceptional cases that may cause
your project to go wrong.
From here onward, you use the Scikit-learn package more and more (which
means knowing more about it — the full documentation appears at http://
scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html). The Scikit-learn
package, in fact, offers a single repository containing almost all the tools that
you need to be a data scientist and for your data science project to be successful.
In this chapter, you discover important characteristics of Scikit-learn,
structured in modules, classes, and functions, and some advanced Python
time savers for improving performance with big unstructured data and highly
time-consuming computational operations.
You don’t have to type the source code for this chapter in by hand. In fact,
it’s a lot easier if you use the downloadable source (see the Introduction
for download instructions). The source code for this chapter appears in
the P4DS4D; 12; Stretching Pythons Capabilities.ipynb source
code file.
