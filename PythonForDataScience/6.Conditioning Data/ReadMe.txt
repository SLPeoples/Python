The characteristics, content, type, and other elements that define your
data in its entirety is the data shape. The shape of your data determines
the kinds of tasks you can perform with it. In order to make your data amenable
to certain types of analysis, you must shape it into a different form. Think
of the data as clay and you as the potter, because that’s the sort of relationship
that exists. However, instead of using your hands to shape the data, you
rely on functions and algorithms to perform the task. This chapter helps you
understand the tools you have available to shape data and the ramifications
of shaping it.
Also in this chapter, you consider the problems associated with shaping. For
example, you need to know what to do when data is missing from a dataset.
It’s important to shape the data correctly or you end up with an analysis that
simply doesn’t make sense. Likewise, some data types, such as dates, can
present problems. Again, you need to tread carefully to ensure that you get
the desired result so that the dataset becomes more useful and amenable to
analysis of various sorts.
The goal of some types of data shaping is to create a larger dataset. In many
cases, the data you need to perform an analysis doesn’t appear in a single
database or in a particular form. You need to shape the data and then combine
it so that you have a single dataset in a known format before you can begin the analysis. 
Combining data successfully can be an art form because data often defies simple analysis or quick fixes.
