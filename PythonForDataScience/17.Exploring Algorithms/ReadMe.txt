In this new part, you start to explore all the algorithms and tools necessary
for learning from data (the training phase) and being capable of predicting
a numeric estimate (for example, house pricing) or a class (for instance, the
species of an Iris flower) given a new example that you didn’t have before. In
this chapter, you start with the simplest algorithms and work toward more
complex ones.
Simple and complex aren’t absolute values in machine learning — they’re
relative to the algorithm’s construction. Some algorithms are simple summations
while others require complex calculations (and Python deals with
both the simple and complex algorithms for you). It’s the data that makes the
difference: For some problems, simple algorithms are better; other problems
may instead require complex algorithms.
You don’t have to type the source code for this chapter manually. In fact,
it’s a lot easier if you use the downloadable source (see the Introduction
for download instructions). The source code for this chapter appears in the
P4DS4D; 17; Exploring Four Simple and Effective Algorithms.
