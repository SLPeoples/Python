Most people visualize information better when they see it in graphic,
versus textual, format. Graphics help people see relationships and
make comparisons with greater ease. Even if you can deal with the abstraction
of textual data with ease, performing data analysis is all about communication.
Unless you can communicate your ideas to other people, the act
of obtaining, shaping, and analyzing the data has little value beyond your
own personal needs. Fortunately, Python makes the task of converting your
textual data into graphics relatively easy using MatPlotLib, which is actually
a simulation of the MATLAB application. You can see a comparison of the
two at http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html.
If you already know how to use MATLAB (see my book, MATLAB For Dummies,
published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., if you’d like to learn), moving over to
MatPlotLib is relatively easy because they both use the same sort of state
machine to perform tasks and they have a similar method of defining graphic
elements. A number of people feel that MatPlotLib is superior to MATLAB
because you can do things like perform tasks using less code when working with
MatPlotLib than when using MATLAB (see http://phillipmfeldman.org/
Python/Advantages_of_Python_Over_Matlab.html). Others have noted
that the transition from MATLAB to MatPlotLib is relatively straightforward
(see https://vnoel.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/bye-matlab-hello-
python-thanks-sage/). However, what matters most is what you think. You
may find that you like to experiment with data using MATLAB and then create
applications based on your findings using Python with MatPlotLib. It’s a matter
of personal taste rather than one of a strict correct answer.
This chapter focuses on getting you up to speed quickly with MatPlotLib. You
do use MatPlotLib quite a few times later in the book, so this short overview
of how it works is important, even if you already know how to work with
MATLAB. That said, the MATLAB experience will be incredibly helpful as you
progress through the chapter, and you may find that you can simply skim
through some sections. Make sure to keep this chapter in mind as you start
working with MatPlotLib in more detail later in the book.
You don’t have to type the source code for this chapter manually. In fact, it’s
a lot easier if you use the downloadable source code. The source code for
this chapter appears in the P4DS4D; 09; Getting a Crash Course in
MatPlotLib.ipynb source code file (see the Introduction for where to find
this code).
