Data science relies on complex algorithms for building predictions and
spotting important signals in data, and each algorithm presents different
strong and weak points. In short, you select a range of algorithms,
you have them run on the data, you optimize their parameters as much as
you can, and finally you decide which one will best help you build your data
product or generate insight into your problem.
It sounds a little bit automatic and, partially, it is, thanks to powerful analytical
software and scripting languages like Python. Learning algorithms are
complex, and their sophisticated procedures naturally seem automatic and
a bit opaque to you. However, even if some of these tools seem like black or
even magic boxes, keep this simple acronym in mind: GIGO. GIGO stands for
“Garbage In/Garbage Out.” It has been a well-known adage in statistics (and
computer science) for a long time. No matter how powerful the machine-
learning algorithms you use, you won’t obtain good results if your data has
something wrong in it.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a general approach to exploring datasets
by means of simple summary statistics and graphic visualizations in order to
gain a deeper understanding of data. EDA helps you become more effective
in the subsequent data analysis and modeling. In this chapter, you discover
all the necessary and indispensable basic descriptions of the data and see
how those descriptions can help you decide how to proceed using the most
appropriate data transformation and solutions.
