Chapter 9 helped you understand the mechanics of working with
MatPlotLib, which is an important first step toward using it. This
chapter takes the next step in helping you use MatPlotLib to perform useful
work. The main goal of this chapter is to help you visualize your data in
various ways. Creating a graphic presentation of your data is essential if you
want to help other people understand what you’re trying to say. Even though
you can see what the numbers mean in your mind, other people will likely
need graphics to see what point you’re trying to make by manipulating data
in various ways.
The chapter starts by looking at some basic graph types that MatPlotLib
supports. You don’t find the full list of graphs and plots listed in this chapter —
it could take an entire book to explore them all in detail. However, you do find
the most common types.
In the remainder of the chapter, you begin exploring specific sorts of plotting
as it relates to data science. Of course, no book on data science would
be complete without exploring scatterplots, which are used to help people
see patterns in seemingly unrelated data points. Because much of the data
that you work with today is time related or geographic in nature, the chapter
devotes two special sections to these topics. You also get to work with both
directed and undirected graphs, which is fine for social media analysis.
You don’t have to type the source code for this chapter manually. In fact, it’s a
lot easier if you use the downloadable source. The source code for this chapter
appears in the P4DS4D; 10; Visualizing the Data.ipynb source code
file (see the Introduction for details on how to find that source file).
