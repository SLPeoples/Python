Machine-learning algorithms can indeed learn from data. For instance,
the four algorithms presented in the previous chapter, although quite
simple, can effectively estimate a class or a value after being presented with
examples associated with outcomes. It is all a matter of learning by induction,
which is the process of extracting general rules from specific exemplifications.
From childhood, humans commonly learn by seeing examples, deriving
some general rules or ideas from them, and then successfully applying the
derived rule to new situations as we grow up. For example, if we see someone
being burned after touching fire, we understand that fire is dangerous, and
we don’t need to touch it ourselves to know that.
Learning by example using machine algorithms has pitfalls. Here are a few
issues that might arise:
? There aren’t enough examples to make a judgment about a rule, no
matter what machine-learning algorithm you are using.
? The machine-learning application is presented with the wrong examples
and consequently cannot reason correctly
? Even when the application sees enough right examples, it still can’t
figure out rules because they’re too complex. Sir Isaac Newton, the
father of modern physics, narrated the story that he was inspired by the
fall of an apple from a tree in his formulation of gravity. Unfortunately,
deriving a universal law from a series of observations is not an automatic
consequence for most of us and the same applies to algorithms.
It’s important to consider these pitfalls when delving into machine learning!
The quantity of data, its quality, and the characteristics of the learning algorithm
decide whether a machine-learning application can generalize well to
new cases. If anything is wrong with any of them, they can pose some serious
limits. As a data science practitioner, you must recognize and learn to avoid
these types of pitfalls in your data science experiments.
